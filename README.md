# ultrasonic_transform

This is a repo to define the different coordinate frames for the ultrasonic sensors, called `frame_id` in ros.
It is based on [this repository](http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf%20broadcaster%20%28Python%29).

## Setup
follow the tutorial slightly, will maybe add better description later.
